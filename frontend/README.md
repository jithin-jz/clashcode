## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Environment Variables:**
   Configure `.env` with:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: Core API base. Use `/api` locally, or `https://api.your-domain.com/api` in deployment.
   - `VITE_CHAT_URL` (or `VITE_WS_URL`): Chat websocket base. Use `/ws/chat` locally, or `wss://api.your-domain.com/ws/chat` in deployment.
   - `VITE_NOTIFICATIONS_WS_URL`: Notifications websocket base. Use `/ws/notifications` locally, or `wss://api.your-domain.com/ws/notifications` in deployment.
   - `VITE_AI_URL`: AI service base. Use `/ai` locally, or `https://api.your-domain.com/ai` in deployment.

   A ready-to-copy local template now lives at `frontend/.env.example`.

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The supported local setup is to keep backend services running through the root `docker-compose.yml`, while the frontend runs directly on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🏗️ Build & Production

To create a production-optimized build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.
