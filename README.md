# CLASHCODE

CLASHCODE is a fun, game-like platform where you can learn and practice coding. Instead of just reading text, you solve challenges to unlock new levels and move through a digital world. With real-time chat and an AI mentor to help when you're stuck, it’s the perfect place to build your skills and connect with other coders.

### 🏗️ Architecture

CLASHCODE is orchestrated on **Amazon EKS** and leverages a distributed topology for maximum scalability.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

CLASHCODE is built using a modern stack including React 19 and Vite for the frontend, and Python with FastAPI and Django for the backend services. We use PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Pinecone, and Redis for data and caching. Everything is managed on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS), Docker, and Terraform.

### 🔒 Security Posture

*   **Isolation**: Untrusted code executes in network-isolated, non-root containers.
*   **Secrets**: Managed via `external-secrets.io` with AWS Secrets Manager integration.
*   **Identity**: Fine-grained resource access via IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA).
*   **Validation**: AST-based pre-validation for all submitted code snippets.
